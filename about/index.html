<p>The Mei* Contemporary Dance Group was founded to have young people at the core of dance production and performance, bringing together the country’s most prolific dance enthusiasts to provide them with a platform for artistic expression and communication. The cultural needs of viewers from all walks of society can be fulfilled via these young dancers’ creations that reflect the trends and characteristics of the modern era. Contemporary dance can be said to be an abstract art form, in which its sense of aesthetic, artistic concepts, dance structure, lexicon etc. are all distinctively different from that of traditional dance. Even so, different forms of dance all share one commonality: life. Essentially, all art comes from our daily lives. Connecting the lexicon common to traditional and contemporary dance, then reforming and combining the concepts and structures make the key point of the group’s future production.</p>

<p>The localisation of dance culture lends itself to be a unique narrative of Australian and Chinese cultures. The vibrance and modernity of Adelaide expressed through the group’s creations showcase how we have come from a place of cultural clashes and confusions towards a stable self positioning, our pursuit of an “Australian flavour” in traditional and contemporary dance, our encouragement for local choreographers, our unique combining of contemporary dance concepts with east-west fusion traditional dance, reflecting its multicultural structure, providing a case for exploration in Chinese contemporary dance. The group’s practice of dance production uses a highly individualistic and modern form of expression to convey the culture of China. We focus on expressing the feelings of “us” and “them” through dance, utilising the relaxed work atmosphere of an overseas region, valuing the thoughts and feelings, pursuits and dreams harboured by the people of today, and seeking deeper meaning within local culture, basing our creations upon its many forms to fuse the east and the west, constructing “boundless” dance performance through an open state of cultural awareness, as the group becomes increasingly involved the building of local dance culture through artistic practice. The Mei* Contemporary Dance Group comprises of young artists in residence at its core working along with exceptional contemporary dance performers. All of our members are youth with a strong dedication to dance, and of course, against the backdrop of multicultural Australia, our dancers come from multicultural backgrounds, too. There are no borders, no nations in art, in dance, or between dancers. Our work is accomplished on the principles of originality and quality, with the characteristics of the modern era as the basis of our creativity, to produce performances which are close to life and reflective of the state of contemporary art, to establish a brand of international acclaim.</p>

<p>Dance is an integrated art form, combining the physical, the artistic, the intellectual and the spiritual in one, and as such is an activity that is beneficial to all aspects of development in young people, as well as enriching their lives out of academic study. Dance education is unique in that its effect on primary and secondary school students cannot be provided through other subjects. For example, dance in primary education can contribute to character building, encouraging students to sense and express beauty. At the same time, teachers must seize the opportunity to appeal to students’ psychological needs via rewarding and appreciation, in order for dance to better exert its positive influence on their growth. Generally speaking, extensive use of dance in primary and secondary education would aid the physical and mental development of children and teens in every constructive way, as it is the ideal method in which students may learn to experience, recognise, understand, and convey the concept of beauty.</p>

<p>Dance can improve fitness and correct bad posture, leading to coordination and grace in one’s movement. Dance training transforms students’ attitudes from passive to assertive, thus training their ability to self-discipline and strengthen willpower. School-aged children are at the stage of life where they are highly curious, active, driven to imitate and perform – traits which can all be fulfilled in a dance lesson. Dance performance requires students to use a high amount of energy, having to practice each move repeatedly, which makes it an activity requiring much hard work, thus, training students’ confidence and motivation to overcome difficulties. Dance also promotes the sense of team pride and honour. Children’s dance classes usually train as a large group initially, then forming set teams during rehearsal and performance. A successful performance is the result of everybody’s work, which gives all involved a sense of team spirit. This sense of team spirit acquired through dance may then be transferred upon the class and the school, perhaps even the culture, the country.</p>

<p>Because of the many educational roles of dance, we have founded the dance group to be one that is suitable for the developmental needs of primary and high school students, and deeply connected with all its aspects. While studying dance, students are also influenced and inspired by music, so it could be said that dance can also be used to explain music. Quoting famous Chinese musician Wu Zuqiang: “In a certain sense, in the art of dance, music is the voice of dance, while dance is the body of music. It is an artistic imagination’s product of perfection.”</p>

<p>The Dynamism Contemporary Folk Orchestra is a Chinese-Western fusion ensemble combining Chinese traditional musical instruments and standard modern orchestral instruments, founded in February 2014. It is Adelaide’s youngest, largest, most complete contemporary folk musical ensemble. Our members are experienced hobbyists from all walks of life, including students, makeup artists, company directors and accountants, brought together by a mutual love of music. The orchestra has been known for its unique originality, the symphonic characteristics of repertoire choice, and high level of proficiency since its establishment. Most notably, the ensemble fuses local musical culture, Chinese traditional music, as well as sounds from different eras, regions and styles around the world, which serves as a dazzling proof of the musicians’ capability. Orchestra members utilise rest time to compose and rehearse a range of new works drawing strong influences from the local cultural, social and artistic atmosphere that shine through their superb performance techniques, and of course, their tireless pursuit for musical excellency.</p>

<p>The orchestra’s aims are to promote folk music culture and to explore contemporary music composition. The orchestra’s future plans include continued rehearsal of classical and contemporary works by Chinese and Western composers, while members will also write new pieces in which they present brave ideas and individual expression, combining elements of traditional Chinese culture, folk culture and a global vision in the context of composition, restructuring the modern perspective of unification of multiculturalism. Composition techniques are inventively modified and innovated from the traditional chamber music format, breaking the barriers between the traditional and the modern, the elegant and the down-to-earth, the east and the west. The musical styles of minority ethnic groups, folk art and contemporary sounds are combined perfectly in rich expressions of cultural character.</p>

<p>The Mei’s Dance Group is South Australia’s first dance group to combine eastern and western cultural elements, incorporating Chinese flavours upon the original framework of Mei’s Dance Company, founded in February 2014 after a long effort owing to the enthusiasm of head of company Qingmei Zhou.</p>

<p>The establishment of the group gives the multicultural city of Adelaide a brand new taste of China, enriching the lives of members of the local Chinese community, as well as providing people of other nationalities and cultures in Australia with the opportunity to enjoy the art of the orient.</p>

<p>Each group that branches from Mei’s Dance Group aims to deliver the most unique representations of Chinese and Australian culture in folk and contemporary dance creations, determined to maintain high standards of professional quality at international levels. The group draws influences from a variety of artistic presentation forms, studies and explores the connections between traditional and modern Chinese culture while taking inspiration from modern western arts. Our working mission is to promote the dance culture of the two nations, service the multicultural arts community, and create art to face international acclaim. Our artistic mission is to spread the influence of oriental art, further cultural exchange, enrich culture and life, and improve health and fitness in communities. The group’s unique training style involves basic dance skills training, group training, as well as choreographing of various dance styles inspired by both Chinese and Australian cultural and artistic elements. We support the promotion of the art of contemporary dance, encourage those with a passion for dance to undergo a well and truly cutting edge dance experience, with a working aim to discover and train the group’s very own talents of world class potential, raise awareness and appreciation of the art of dance among the wider population, to our friends from all walks of life, uniting us in our contribution to cultural and artistic exchange between the two nations.</p>
