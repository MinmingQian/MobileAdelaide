<p>The Mei* Contemporary Dance Group was founded to have young people at the core of dance production and performance, bringing together the country’s most prolific dance enthusiasts to provide them with a platform for artistic expression and communication. The cultural needs of viewers from all walks of society can be fulfilled via these young dancers’ creations that reflect the trends and characteristics of the modern era. Contemporary dance can be said to be an abstract art form, in which its sense of aesthetic, artistic concepts, dance structure, lexicon etc. are all distinctively different from that of traditional dance. Even so, different forms of dance all share one commonality: life. Essentially, all art comes from our daily lives. Connecting the lexicon common to traditional and contemporary dance, then reforming and combining the concepts and structures make the key point of the group’s future production.

The localisation of dance culture lends itself to be a unique narrative of Australian and Chinese cultures. The vibrance and modernity of Adelaide expressed through the group’s creations showcase how we have come from a place of cultural clashes and confusions towards a stable self positioning, our pursuit of an “Australian flavour” in traditional and contemporary dance, our encouragement for local choreographers, our unique combining of contemporary dance concepts with east-west fusion traditional dance, reflecting its multicultural structure, providing a case for exploration in Chinese contemporary dance. The group’s practice of dance production uses a highly individualistic and modern form of expression to convey the culture of China. We focus on expressing the feelings of “us” and “them” through dance, utilising the relaxed work atmosphere of an overseas region, valuing the thoughts and feelings, pursuits and dreams harboured by the people of today, and seeking deeper meaning within local culture, basing our creations upon its many forms to fuse the east and the west, constructing “boundless” dance performance through an open state of cultural awareness, as the group becomes increasingly involved the building of local dance culture through artistic practice. The Mei* Contemporary Dance Group comprises of young artists in residence at its core working along with exceptional contemporary dance performers. All of our members are youth with a strong dedication to dance, and of course, against the backdrop of multicultural Australia, our dancers come from multicultural backgrounds, too. There are no borders, no nations in art, in dance, or between dancers. Our work is accomplished on the principles of originality and quality, with the characteristics of the modern era as the basis of our creativity, to produce performances which are close to life and reflective of the state of contemporary art, to establish a brand of international acclaim.</p>

<p>Dance is an integrated art form, combining the physical, the artistic, the intellectual and the spiritual in one, and as such is an activity that is beneficial to all aspects of development in young people, as well as enriching their lives out of academic study. Dance education is unique in that its effect on primary and secondary school students cannot be provided through other subjects. For example, dance in primary education can contribute to character building, encouraging students to sense and express beauty. At the same time, teachers must seize the opportunity to appeal to students’ psychological needs via rewarding and appreciation, in order for dance to better exert its positive influence on their growth. Generally speaking, extensive use of dance in primary and secondary education would aid the physical and mental development of children and teens in every constructive way, as it is the ideal method in which students may learn to experience, recognise, understand, and convey the concept of beauty.

Dance can improve fitness and correct bad posture, leading to coordination and grace in one’s movement. Dance training transforms students’ attitudes from passive to assertive, thus training their ability to self-discipline and strengthen willpower. School-aged children are at the stage of life where they are highly curious, active, driven to imitate and perform – traits which can all be fulfilled in a dance lesson. Dance performance requires students to use a high amount of energy, having to practice each move repeatedly, which makes it an activity requiring much hard work, thus, training students’ confidence and motivation to overcome difficulties. Dance also promotes the sense of team pride and honour. Children’s dance classes usually train as a large group initially, then forming set teams during rehearsal and performance. A successful performance is the result of everybody’s work, which gives all involved a sense of team spirit. This sense of team spirit acquired through dance may then be transferred upon the class and the school, perhaps even the culture, the country.</p>

<p>Because of the many educational roles of dance, we have founded the dance group to be one that is suitable for the developmental needs of primary and high school students, and deeply connected with all its aspects. While studying dance, students are also influenced and inspired by music, so it could be said that dance can also be used to explain music. Quoting famous Chinese musician Wu Zuqiang: “In a certain sense, in the art of dance, music is the voice of dance, while dance is the body of music. It is an artistic imagination’s product of perfection.”</p>

<p>The Dynamism Contemporary Folk Orchestra is a Chinese-Western fusion ensemble combining Chinese traditional musical instruments and standard modern orchestral instruments, founded in February 2014. It is Adelaide’s youngest, largest, most complete contemporary folk musical ensemble. Our members are experienced hobbyists from all walks of life, including students, makeup artists, company directors and accountants, brought together by a mutual love of music. The orchestra has been known for its unique originality, the symphonic characteristics of repertoire choice, and high level of proficiency since its establishment. Most notably, the ensemble fuses local musical culture, Chinese traditional music, as well as sounds from different eras, regions and styles around the world, which serves as a dazzling proof of the musicians’ capability. Orchestra members utilise rest time to compose and rehearse a range of new works drawing strong influences from the local cultural, social and artistic atmosphere that shine through their superb performance techniques, and of course, their tireless pursuit for musical excellency.

The orchestra’s aims are to promote folk music culture and to explore contemporary music composition. The orchestra’s future plans include continued rehearsal of classical and contemporary works by Chinese and Western composers, while members will also write new pieces in which they present brave ideas and individual expression, combining elements of traditional Chinese culture, folk culture and a global vision in the context of composition, restructuring the modern perspective of unification of multiculturalism. Composition techniques are inventively modified and innovated from the traditional chamber music format, breaking the barriers between the traditional and the modern, the elegant and the down-to-earth, the east and the west. The musical styles of minority ethnic groups, folk art and contemporary sounds are combined perfectly in rich expressions of cultural character.</p>

<p>The founder Q.M. Zhou is a professional dancer and choreographer. Under the influence of the dance coach she had who is her mother, Zhou received systematic professional training as a child, in styles including classical Chinese dance, Chinese folk and ethnic dance, and ballet. Zhou has majored in ballroom dancing at the Beijing Dance Academy, studied contemporary dance at TAFE SA, and is a prolific choreographer in Adelaide’s Chinese community holding dual degrees in dance.</p>

<p>During the past decade or so in my learning, I have given most of my time and energy to my dance career. I knew that there comes a time where I must pay back. My mother has supported me on my way throughout this journey, allowing me to navigate the field of dance with ease. I have received countless awards in various dance competitions, in which most of my performances were choreographed by my mother. I earned valuable teaching and stage experience during my time participating in Chinese style dance performance and choreography. When I was on the stage, whether I was performing a self-written routine or other people’s work, my mother always required that I face the task with utmost passion, not allowing me to commit even the slightest error. </p>

<p>If my study of dance in China can be counted as accumulation of experience, then my studies here in the capital city of South Australia would be improvement of practice. Moving from Chinese traditional dance to contemporary Western dance offered me the opportunity for a giant leap in my dance career. Through my transition from the Chinese traditional system of education to a much more liberal, self-directed education format, I gradually learnt to regulate my ability to adjust. And through the clashes between the differing dance cultures of Australia and China, I learnt of each of their most treasurable essences, witnessing first-hand the brilliance of each country’s artistic vocabulary. This provided me with abundant information to further cultural exchange between the two nations in future, and also gave me a solid foundation for later work.</p>

<p>I am an easy-going, cheerful and generous person. To be modest and a good listener, and to learn and grow is my motto. Outside of work, I enjoy chatting with my friends over a coffee or a meal. Of course, in multicultural Australia, I have friends from a variety of cultural backgrounds, since I like to make friends from different work environments and upbringings, and see it as a way of learning. Although I have lived in Adelaide for over a decade, I have always upheld my career and personal ethos, “three nos, three yeses” form my basic principles:
	I will NOT give up my dedication and passion for dance due to changes in my environment.
	I will NOT give up determination to achieve my dreams because of temporary difficulties.
	I will NOT give up my faith and confidence in my goals because of setbacks from failure.
	I am honest in my approaches towards others, and will cut off relations with those who have no morals, or are habitual liars.
	I am a trustworthy person, who would always face my friends with a tolerant and respectful attitude, while people who are cunning and selfish will never be in my circle of friends.
	I understand the importance of being thankful; I am thankful for that my parents have raised me and that my family have always supported me, thankful for all of my friends who have helped me in the past and present.</p>

<p>Since my mother was performing on stage while pregnant with a three-month-old me, fate has decided that I live to dance! To me, dance isn’t as simple as just moving my arms and legs, or repeating cycles of work, performance and skills training. Dance is the driving force of life flowing in my blood, the hardship and determination all along my road to today, the sheer happiness of producing a successful piece of work after gathering experience from having choreographed countless failed works. Dance is my eternal thanks to my mother for what she gave to me and my career, my endless memories of my father, the definitive positioning of my future career target!</p>

<p>Once again, I would like to give thanks to my mother for fostering my career as a dance artist, to my father for encouraging me to be an all-rounded high achiever, to all of my teachers who had mentored me, to all of my friends who have given me their help and support.</p>

<p>Gao Mobo (Honorary dean、language and culture consultant) 
Professor Gao currently teaches Chinese at the Center for Asian Studies at the University of Adelaide, and dean of the University’s Confucius Institute.
Professor Gao studied in the UK, where he worked for eight years, and later worked at Griffith University in Queensland and taught at the University of Tasmania. In 2008 he was appointed Professor of Chinese Studies at the University of Adelaide.
His English books include: “Gao Village,” “Mandarin Chinese: An Introduction”, “A Reference to Mandarin Chinese”, and “The Battle for China’s Past: Mao and the Cultural Revolution”. In particular, the books “Gao Village” and “The Battle” led him to become a renowned scholar worldwide.
Gao said on academic success that “success is but an experience”, that he never considered if the path he had taken has reached the goal of success, and that as long as one does the things they want to do, it is enough. He never did research to catch the trend or for the sake of research. He even said modestly that his luck was good, that he came across opportunities as well as grasped them. Now, Gao just thinks that the time he has is not enough, as there are many plans to carry out, which need time and energy to be invested.
As dean of the Confucius Institute, Professor Gao put a lot of effort into the promotion of the Chinese language and cultural exchange in South Australia.
Professor Gao’s position in the group is of no relation to his position at his current workplace, and was in accordance with his own will.</p>
