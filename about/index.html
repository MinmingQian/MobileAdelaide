<p>The Mei* Contemporary Dance Group was founded to have young people at the core of dance production and performance, bringing together the country’s most prolific dance enthusiasts to provide them with a platform for artistic expression and communication. The cultural needs of viewers from all walks of society can be fulfilled via these young dancers’ creations that reflect the trends and characteristics of the modern era. Contemporary dance can be said to be an abstract art form, in which its sense of aesthetic, artistic concepts, dance structure, lexicon etc. are all distinctively different from that of traditional dance. Even so, different forms of dance all share one commonality: life. Essentially, all art comes from our daily lives. Connecting the lexicon common to traditional and contemporary dance, then reforming and combining the concepts and structures make the key point of the group’s future production.</p>

<p>The localisation of dance culture lends itself to be a unique narrative of Australian and Chinese cultures. The vibrance and modernity of Adelaide expressed through the group’s creations showcase how we have come from a place of cultural clashes and confusions towards a stable self positioning, our pursuit of an “Australian flavour” in traditional and contemporary dance, our encouragement for local choreographers, our unique combining of contemporary dance concepts with east-west fusion traditional dance, reflecting its multicultural structure, providing a case for exploration in Chinese contemporary dance. The group’s practice of dance production uses a highly individualistic and modern form of expression to convey the culture of China. We focus on expressing the feelings of “us” and “them” through dance, utilising the relaxed work atmosphere of an overseas region, valuing the thoughts and feelings, pursuits and dreams harboured by the people of today, and seeking deeper meaning within local culture, basing our creations upon its many forms to fuse the east and the west, constructing “boundless” dance performance through an open state of cultural awareness, as the group becomes increasingly involved the building of local dance culture through artistic practice. The Mei* Contemporary Dance Group comprises of young artists in residence at its core working along with exceptional contemporary dance performers. All of our members are youth with a strong dedication to dance, and of course, against the backdrop of multicultural Australia, our dancers come from multicultural backgrounds, too. There are no borders, no nations in art, in dance, or between dancers. Our work is accomplished on the principles of originality and quality, with the characteristics of the modern era as the basis of our creativity, to produce performances which are close to life and reflective of the state of contemporary art, to establish a brand of international acclaim.</p>

<h2 id="the-dynamism-youth-dance-group">The Dynamism Youth Dance Group</h2>

<p>Dance is an integrated art form, combining the physical, the artistic, the intellectual and the spiritual in one, and as such is an activity that is beneficial to all aspects of development in young people, as well as enriching their lives out of academic study. Dance education is unique in that its effect on primary and secondary school students cannot be provided through other subjects. For example, dance in primary education can contribute to character building, encouraging students to sense and express beauty. At the same time, teachers must seize the opportunity to appeal to students’ psychological needs via rewarding and appreciation, in order for dance to better exert its positive influence on their growth. Generally speaking, extensive use of dance in primary and secondary education would aid the physical and mental development of children and teens in every constructive way, as it is the ideal method in which students may learn to experience, recognise, understand, and convey the concept of beauty.</p>

<p>Dance can improve fitness and correct bad posture, leading to coordination and grace in one’s movement. Dance training transforms students’ attitudes from passive to assertive, thus training their ability to self-discipline and strengthen willpower. School-aged children are at the stage of life where they are highly curious, active, driven to imitate and perform – traits which can all be fulfilled in a dance lesson. Dance performance requires students to use a high amount of energy, having to practice each move repeatedly, which makes it an activity requiring much hard work, thus, training students’ confidence and motivation to overcome difficulties. Dance also promotes the sense of team pride and honour. Children’s dance classes usually train as a large group initially, then forming set teams during rehearsal and performance. A successful performance is the result of everybody’s work, which gives all involved a sense of team spirit. This sense of team spirit acquired through dance may then be transferred upon the class and the school, perhaps even the culture, the country.</p>

<p>Because of the many educational roles of dance, we have founded the dance group to be one that is suitable for the developmental needs of primary and high school students, and deeply connected with all its aspects. While studying dance, students are also influenced and inspired by music, so it could be said that dance can also be used to explain music. Quoting famous Chinese musician Wu Zuqiang: “In a certain sense, in the art of dance, music is the voice of dance, while dance is the body of music. It is an artistic imagination’s product of perfection.”</p>

<p>The Dynamism Contemporary Folk Orchestra is a Chinese-Western fusion ensemble combining Chinese traditional musical instruments and standard modern orchestral instruments, founded in February 2014. It is Adelaide’s youngest, largest, most complete contemporary folk musical ensemble. Our members are experienced hobbyists from all walks of life, including students, makeup artists, company directors and accountants, brought together by a mutual love of music. The orchestra has been known for its unique originality, the symphonic characteristics of repertoire choice, and high level of proficiency since its establishment. Most notably, the ensemble fuses local musical culture, Chinese traditional music, as well as sounds from different eras, regions and styles around the world, which serves as a dazzling proof of the musicians’ capability. Orchestra members utilise rest time to compose and rehearse a range of new works drawing strong influences from the local cultural, social and artistic atmosphere that shine through their superb performance techniques, and of course, their tireless pursuit for musical excellency.</p>

<p>The orchestra’s aims are to promote folk music culture and to explore contemporary music composition. The orchestra’s future plans include continued rehearsal of classical and contemporary works by Chinese and Western composers, while members will also write new pieces in which they present brave ideas and individual expression, combining elements of traditional Chinese culture, folk culture and a global vision in the context of composition, restructuring the modern perspective of unification of multiculturalism. Composition techniques are inventively modified and innovated from the traditional chamber music format, breaking the barriers between the traditional and the modern, the elegant and the down-to-earth, the east and the west. The musical styles of minority ethnic groups, folk art and contemporary sounds are combined perfectly in rich expressions of cultural character.</p>

<p>The Mei’s Dance Group is South Australia’s first dance group to combine eastern and western cultural elements, incorporating Chinese flavours upon the original framework of Mei’s Dance Company, founded in February 2014 after a long effort owing to the enthusiasm of head of company Qingmei Zhou.</p>

<p>The establishment of the group gives the multicultural city of Adelaide a brand new taste of China, enriching the lives of members of the local Chinese community, as well as providing people of other nationalities and cultures in Australia with the opportunity to enjoy the art of the orient.</p>

<p>Each group that branches from Mei’s Dance Group aims to deliver the most unique representations of Chinese and Australian culture in folk and contemporary dance creations, determined to maintain high standards of professional quality at international levels. The group draws influences from a variety of artistic presentation forms, studies and explores the connections between traditional and modern Chinese culture while taking inspiration from modern western arts. Our working mission is to promote the dance culture of the two nations, service the multicultural arts community, and create art to face international acclaim. Our artistic mission is to spread the influence of oriental art, further cultural exchange, enrich culture and life, and improve health and fitness in communities. The group’s unique training style involves basic dance skills training, group training, as well as choreographing of various dance styles inspired by both Chinese and Australian cultural and artistic elements. We support the promotion of the art of contemporary dance, encourage those with a passion for dance to undergo a well and truly cutting edge dance experience, with a working aim to discover and train the group’s very own talents of world class potential, raise awareness and appreciation of the art of dance among the wider population, to our friends from all walks of life, uniting us in our contribution to cultural and artistic exchange between the two nations.</p>

<p>The Mei’s Dance Group has bred the following creative and cultural industries brands: the Mei* Contemporary Dance Group, the Dynamism Youth Dance Group, and the Dynamism Contemporary Folk Orchestra.</p>

创办人Q.M Zhou是一位专业的舞蹈演员兼舞蹈编导，在母亲这位舞蹈教授的熏陶下，自幼在中国接受了系统的专业训练 - 中国古典舞和中国民族民间舞，芭蕾舞，曾经就读北京舞蹈学院社交系专修国际标准舞，在阿德莱德艺术技术学院学习当代舞蹈，同时也是在阿德莱德华人中一位拥有舞蹈双学位的华人专业舞蹈编导。
之前十几年的学习舞蹈过程里我大部分的时间和精力都给了舞蹈事业，付出总有回报的时候，加上母亲一路上的扶持，让我在舞蹈领域里如鱼得水，而且在各种舞蹈比赛里得过无数的奖励，其中大部分是母亲编导的作品。在中国式的舞蹈演出和编舞历练期间我从中得到了宝贵的教学经验和舞台经验，在舞台上演出时不管是自己编导的舞蹈作品还是演示他人的舞蹈作品，都让我用心去完成，不能有丝毫的失误和偏差，尽量做到最完美，有时为了编排一个作品甚至和母亲争执到脸红脖子粗，到最后还要和母亲说对不起，即使是我没有错…..这就是我Q M Zhou. 
如果说在中国期间的舞蹈学习是经验积累的话，那么在南澳大利亚的省会阿德莱德期间的舞蹈学习应该是实践的提升。从传统的中国舞蹈到西方当代舞蹈我在自己的舞蹈事业上有了质的飞越。从接受中国传统的教育到后来接受西方自由发挥的教育中慢慢学会调节自己的适应能力。在中西舞蹈艺术文化的碰撞中我学到了两国间的艺术精髓，亲身体验到了中澳两国各自的舞蹈艺术语汇的精彩之处，为我能在未来积极推动两国文化交流提供了丰富的信息，同时也为以后的工作奠定了坚固的基础。
本人是位随和的人，性格开朗、大方，谦虚和聆听、边成长边学习是我的座右铭！在工作之余喜欢和朋友喝咖啡、吃饭、聊天，在澳洲这个有着多元文化的国土上当然朋友也是有着多元文化背景的，我喜欢结交不同工作环境和不同文化背景的朋友，这也是我学习的一种方式。虽然已经在阿德莱德生活了十几年，但是在事业和怎样做人上有自己的原则和底线，三‘不会’和三‘是’是我的基本理念：
* 不会因为环境的改变而放弃对舞蹈的执着和热情
* 不会因为暂时的困难而放弃对梦想的实现和坚持
* 不会因为失败的挫折而放弃对目标的信心和信念
* 是爱憎分明的人，对没有道德观念和习惯性撒谎的人杜绝来往。
* 是值得信赖的人，对朋友始终保持宽容和尊重的心态，斤斤计较的小人永远不再朋友圈里。
* 是知道感恩的人，对父母的培养和家人支持的感恩，周围所有人曾经和现在对我帮助和扶持过的朋友的感恩。</p>

<p>从母亲怀着只有3个月大的我在舞台上表演舞剧的那时起，命运就注定了我和舞蹈永远的结缘！舞蹈对于我来说不是单纯的手舞足蹈，不仅仅是每天的重复工作演出和基本功训练，舞蹈是流淌在我身体里的沸腾的能量血液，舞蹈是事业上一路走过来的坚信和艰辛，舞蹈是我在编排了无数个失败的作品背后所获得经验和一部成功作品的喜悦，舞蹈是万分感谢母亲在事业上的给予，舞蹈是我对父亲无限的思念，舞蹈是我未来事业目标的定位！</p>

<p>最后，感谢母亲对我在舞蹈事业上的栽培，感谢父亲教育我做一个品学兼优的舞者，感谢所有教授过我舞蹈技术的老师们。感谢所有朋友一路上的支持和扶持。</p>

<p>高默波 （名誉团长及语言和文化顾问）
现任阿德莱德大学亚洲研究中心中文系教授，阿德莱德大学孔子学院院长。
高教授在英国留学和工作先后八年，后来又先后在格里菲斯和塔斯马尼亚大学任教，于2008 年被阿德莱德大学聘任为中国研究讲座教授。
高默波教授的英文著作包括：《高家村》， 《汉语引论》， 《汉语指南》 和《为中国的过去而争论：毛和“文革》. 尤其是《高家村》 和《为中国的过去而争论：毛和“文革》两本书使他成为世界知名学者。
关于学术上的成功，高教授说；成功不过是一种经历，自己从来没有去考量自己走过的道路是否达到了成功的目标，只要做好自己愿意做的事情就足够了。他从来不为赶潮流或是搞研究去研究。 他甚至谦虚地说是自己的运气不错，有些机遇让自己遇到了而且也把握住了。现在只是觉得时间不够用，因为有很多计划要去实现，需要投入时间和精力。
作为孔子学院的院长，高教授在南澳努力为汉语推广和文化交流做了大量的工作。
高教授担任艺术团职位与本人在工作单位没有任何关系，属于本人自愿。</p>

<p>Gao Mobo (Honorary dean、language and culture consultant) 
Professor Gao currently teaches Chinese at the Center for Asian Studies at the University of Adelaide, and dean of the University’s Confucius Institute.
Professor Gao studied in the UK, where he worked for eight years, and later worked at Griffith University in Queensland and taught at the University of Tasmania. In 2008 he was appointed Professor of Chinese Studies at the University of Adelaide.
His English books include: “Gao Village,” “Mandarin Chinese: An Introduction”, “A Reference to Mandarin Chinese”, and “The Battle for China’s Past: Mao and the Cultural Revolution”. In particular, the books “Gao Village” and “The Battle” led him to become a renowned scholar worldwide.
Gao said on academic success that “success is but an experience”, that he never considered if the path he had taken has reached the goal of success, and that as long as one does the things they want to do, it is enough. He never did research to catch the trend or for the sake of research. He even said modestly that his luck was good, that he came across opportunities as well as grasped them. Now, Gao just thinks that the time he has is not enough, as there are many plans to carry out, which need time and energy to be invested.
As dean of the Confucius Institute, Professor Gao put a lot of effort into the promotion of the Chinese language and cultural exchange in South Australia.
Professor Gao’s position in the group is of no relation to his position at his current workplace, and was in accordance with his own will.</p>

See has said himself to be an ordinary businessman, but passionate about community development, eagerly involved in the Chinese community’s career development, which is why he spent time, energy and financial resources on social activities. The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce is committed to promoting trade between South Australia and China and cultural exchange under See’s leadership. 
See is full of anticipation and longing when it comes to South Australia’s future. He said: “everyone knows that doing community is difficult, I fully understand that, but I will stick to it even if it is difficult. Us Chinese people have a saying ‘take it from the community, use it on the community.’” 
See is honoured to be a part of the troupe, honoured to be able to work for the cultural life and cultural promotion of the Chinese community, especially while the fusion of the two countries’ dance culture is the troupe’s future plan and a brave attempt.
