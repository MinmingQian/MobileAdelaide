                <title>梅*当代舞蹈团</title>
                <description>
&lt;p&gt;梅&lt;em&gt;当代舞蹈团成立为一个以年轻人为核心创作、表演的舞团，集合全国优秀的自由舞者，为他们提供一个艺术服务平台，通过年轻人创造具有时代特征的精品，以满足社会更多层面人士的文化生活需求。当代舞是一门比较抽象的艺术，它的审美意识、艺术概念、舞蹈架构、语汇都与传统的舞蹈艺术截然不同。然而，舞蹈又有它们之间共同点: 生活元素 - 所有艺术来自于我们的生活, 把当代舞和民族民间舞的相通舞蹈语汇相结合，再把不同的概念和架构给予融合性改变并结合，这就是舞蹈团未来创作的重点。
&lt;!--more--&gt;
　　舞蹈文化的本土化实际上是对澳洲和中国文化的一种特殊的表述，舞团舞蹈创作所展示的阿德莱德城市活力和当代文化，说明我们当代舞蹈团如何从一个多元混杂的文化状态走向自我定位，如何追求传统舞和现代舞的“澳洲特色”，如何鼓励本地编舞，如何将现代舞的包容理念转向中西传统舞蹈结合，对应其多元化的文化结构，为中国舞蹈的现代性探索提供一个实验案例。舞团的创作实践是以一种十分个性化的当代方式表达中国文化，我们是以舞蹈表现出“我们”和“他们” 的感受，利用海外地区创作宽松的环境，以舞蹈团重视现代人的思想和感觉、现代人的生活与需求、现代人的追求和理想，追寻本地人的文化内涵， 以本地文化的多种形态为创作原质，融合中西，以一种开放的文化态势，构筑“无边”的舞蹈。通过艺术实践让舞团走向本土的舞蹈文化建设。梅&lt;/em&gt;当代舞蹈团以年轻驻团艺术家为核心优秀现代舞者共同组成。成员都是执著于追求舞蹈艺术的年轻人，在有着多元文化背景的澳洲，舞团的成员当然也是有着多元文化背景的。艺术没有国界，舞蹈没有国界，舞者没有国界。作品均以“原创性、高品质”为原则，以当下时代特征为创作背景，打造贴近生活，反映当代艺术的精品为目标，打造国际化高水平艺术团队品牌。&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>The Mei* Contemporary Dance Group</title>
                <description>
&lt;p&gt;The Mei* Contemporary Dance Group was founded to have young people at the core of dance production and performance, bringing together the country’s most prolific dance enthusiasts to provide them with a platform for artistic expression and communication. The cultural needs of viewers from all walks of society can be fulfilled via these young dancers’ creations that reflect the trends and characteristics of the modern era. Contemporary dance can be said to be an abstract art form, in which its sense of aesthetic, artistic concepts, dance structure, lexicon etc. are all distinctively different from that of traditional dance. Even so, different forms of dance all share one commonality: life. Essentially, all art comes from our daily lives. Connecting the lexicon common to traditional and contemporary dance, then reforming and combining the concepts and structures make the key point of the group’s future production.
&lt;!--more--&gt;
The localisation of dance culture lends itself to be a unique narrative of Australian and Chinese cultures. The vibrance and modernity of Adelaide expressed through the group’s creations showcase how we have come from a place of cultural clashes and confusions towards a stable self positioning, our pursuit of an “Australian flavour” in traditional and contemporary dance, our encouragement for local choreographers, our unique combining of contemporary dance concepts with east-west fusion traditional dance, reflecting its multicultural structure, providing a case for exploration in Chinese contemporary dance. The group’s practice of dance production uses a highly individualistic and modern form of expression to convey the culture of China. We focus on expressing the feelings of “us” and “them” through dance, utilising the relaxed work atmosphere of an overseas region, valuing the thoughts and feelings, pursuits and dreams harboured by the people of today, and seeking deeper meaning within local culture, basing our creations upon its many forms to fuse the east and the west, constructing “boundless” dance performance through an open state of cultural awareness, as the group becomes increasingly involved the building of local dance culture through artistic practice. The Mei* Contemporary Dance Group comprises of young artists in residence at its core working along with exceptional contemporary dance performers. All of our members are youth with a strong dedication to dance, and of course, against the backdrop of multicultural Australia, our dancers come from multicultural backgrounds, too. There are no borders, no nations in art, in dance, or between dancers. Our work is accomplished on the principles of originality and quality, with the characteristics of the modern era as the basis of our creativity, to produce performances which are close to life and reflective of the state of contemporary art, to establish a brand of international acclaim.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>活力青少年舞蹈团</title>
                <description>
&lt;p&gt;活力青少年舞蹈团是创建2003年8月，是开在澳洲这片多元文化的国土上开放的一支含苞待放的小花蕾。是由全市具有优秀舞蹈潜质的在校学生组成的少儿舞蹈艺术团体, 在这里学习舞蹈的孩子是一群在舞蹈世界里自由翱翔的梦想家，他们享有着一流的教学环境及优秀的师资资源。舞蹈团成立为一个以青少年为核心的表演舞蹈团。演出的舞蹈作品和训练课程基本结合澳中两国的文化背景而定制，为了就是让在澳洲有着不同背景的孩子们和华人后代在澳洲也能学习到中国传统的艺术文化，让中华文化继续在这个美丽的国土上传承下去。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;活力青少儿舞蹈团的办团宗旨是：1、培养学生艺术兴趣，提升学生艺术修养，增强学生艺术素质。2、逐步打造和树立舞蹈艺术的优质品牌，争取在澳洲-阿德莱德乃至中国和国际上有一定的知名度。3、为发展地方经济、学生业余生活、构建和谐社会作出应有贡献。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;舞蹈团将根据每年小学员人数定量的原则，每年都有计划地进行选拔与考核，挑选优秀小演员按比例升入艺术团演出团队，形成表演班和预备班，实现学员的优化组合。在团队建设过程中，以节目创排为主要，进行分层次的专业技能技巧和综合能力的培训。每学期根据学员年龄、学员基础，制定不同的教学计划和教学内容，有重点地加强某一方面能力的训练。教学以丰富的中国民族民间舞素材、规范的芭蕾舞训练、揉入西方各种舞蹈种类的训练、优秀的创编节目及保留节目排练等为内容，提高学生的技能、技巧和表演能力。每学期的学校假期，都安排小演员集训，并且聘请当地专业团体的资深老师对学生们进行指点和强化训练，提高孩子们的专业舞蹈技艺。
&lt;!--more--&gt;
舞蹈是一门综合性艺术，它集体能、艺能、知能、气质于一体，对青少年各方面素质均起着促进作用。同时丰富学生的课余生活，陶冶学生的情操。舞蹈教育是很独特的一门教育，它在小学、中学所发挥的作用是其它学科不具备的，舞蹈教育在小学教育中，能更好地更形象地培养学生的品德性格，提高学生的身体素质，发展智力、表现能力，让小学生感知美、表现美，同样，教师也要抓住学生心理采用“赏识教育”，让舞蹈更充分在学生成长中发挥到作用。总之普及舞蹈教育在中小学阶段，能更好地促进学生身心发展，让学生在舞蹈中真实地感受美、认识美、理解美、表现美。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;舞蹈能增强体质，改变不良姿态，使其动作协调优美。舞蹈训练使学生变被动为主动，培养其自制、自持能力及意志品质。青少年儿童好奇心强，好动、爱模仿、表现舞蹈课、能满足其以上特征。表现性舞蹈的学习使学生出大力，流大汗，每个动作都要反复进行训练，付出辛勤的劳动，这能培养学生战胜困难的信心和力量，使其意志品质得到锻炼。舞蹈能增强集体荣誉感。青少儿舞蹈一般都是以群体为主，再排练演出形成一定的集体。一个舞蹈节目排练演出成功，是大家共同努力得到，可以增强集体向心力，以集体成功为荣。按学习迁移规律，在舞蹈排练中形成的集体荣誉感可以迁移到班集体、校集体，甚至一个民族、一个国家的集体荣誉感上去。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;基于舞蹈的种种教育作用，我们把创建舞蹈社团，使它们相互关联、亲密配合，使之更适合中小学生的发展要求。学生在学习舞蹈的同时，亦受到音乐的熏陶，在某种程度上说，舞蹈亦用来解释音乐，借用我国著名音乐家吴祖强的话说：“从一定意义上说：在舞蹈艺术中，音乐是舞蹈的声音，舞蹈则是音乐的形体，一个有形上反映人的指挥的至美的艺术想象产物之一”。&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>The Dynamism Youth Dance Group</title>
                <description>
&lt;p&gt;Dance is an integrated art form, combining the physical, the artistic, the intellectual and the spiritual in one, and as such is an activity that is beneficial to all aspects of development in young people, as well as enriching their lives out of academic study. Dance education is unique in that its effect on primary and secondary school students cannot be provided through other subjects. For example, dance in primary education can contribute to character building, encouraging students to sense and express beauty. At the same time, teachers must seize the opportunity to appeal to students’ psychological needs via rewarding and appreciation, in order for dance to better exert its positive influence on their growth. Generally speaking, extensive use of dance in primary and secondary education would aid the physical and mental development of children and teens in every constructive way, as it is the ideal method in which students may learn to experience, recognise, understand, and convey the concept of beauty.
&lt;!--more--&gt;
Dance can improve fitness and correct bad posture, leading to coordination and grace in one’s movement. Dance training transforms students’ attitudes from passive to assertive, thus training their ability to self-discipline and strengthen willpower. School-aged children are at the stage of life where they are highly curious, active, driven to imitate and perform – traits which can all be fulfilled in a dance lesson. Dance performance requires students to use a high amount of energy, having to practice each move repeatedly, which makes it an activity requiring much hard work, thus, training students’ confidence and motivation to overcome difficulties. Dance also promotes the sense of team pride and honour. Children’s dance classes usually train as a large group initially, then forming set teams during rehearsal and performance. A successful performance is the result of everybody’s work, which gives all involved a sense of team spirit. This sense of team spirit acquired through dance may then be transferred upon the class and the school, perhaps even the culture, the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the many educational roles of dance, we have founded the dance group to be one that is suitable for the developmental needs of primary and high school students, and deeply connected with all its aspects. While studying dance, students are also influenced and inspired by music, so it could be said that dance can also be used to explain music. Quoting famous Chinese musician Wu Zuqiang: “In a certain sense, in the art of dance, music is the voice of dance, while dance is the body of music. It is an artistic imagination’s product of perfection.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;活力现代民族乐团成立于２０１４年２月，是以中国民族民间乐器和现代乐器组合成的一中西音乐结合的乐团。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本乐团目前是阿德莱德最年轻、编制最齐全、以中西音乐为创作基础、规模最大的一支自由组织的现代民族乐团，乐团由二十几位具有丰富表演经验的优秀中青年爱好者组成，他们当中有学生、化妆师、老板、会计师等等，乐团的队员们因为音乐走到了一起，乐团自成立以來始终立足于风格上的独具匠心性、作品曲目上的交响性和演奏技术的高超性。同时将本土音乐文化和中国民族音乐与世界不同时代、不同地区、不同风格的音乐融为一体，以此展示该团強大的活力与潜力。成员们利用休息时间创作和排练了许多具有该区浓郁的民族特色和地域风情的新作品，凭借精湛的演奏技法和对音乐艺术孜孜不倦的追求，使这些新作品焕发出旺盛的艺术生命力。
&lt;!--more--&gt;
乐团的宗旨是：弘扬民族音乐文化，探索现代音乐创作。乐团未来的计划会相继排练部分中西作曲家创作的传统和现代作品，而且乐团的成员也会创作一些新作品，这些作品构思大胆自由，彰显独特个性。在创作理念上，将中国传统文化、民族文化与国际化视野相融合，重构了多元文化为一体的现代观念；在创作技法上，对传统室内音乐创作模式进行了创新，冲破了传统与现代、高雅与流行、东方与西方的隔阂，充满创新精神；在作品风格上，将少数民族、民间音乐元素与现代音乐表现手法完美结合，具有浓郁的民族特色和地域风情。&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>The Dynamism Contemporary Folk Orchestra</title>
                <description>
&lt;p&gt;The Dynamism Contemporary Folk Orchestra is a Chinese-Western fusion ensemble combining Chinese traditional musical instruments and standard modern orchestral instruments, founded in February 2014. It is Adelaide’s youngest, largest, most complete contemporary folk musical ensemble. Our members are experienced hobbyists from all walks of life, including students, makeup artists, company directors and accountants, brought together by a mutual love of music. The orchestra has been known for its unique originality, the symphonic characteristics of repertoire choice, and high level of proficiency since its establishment. Most notably, the ensemble fuses local musical culture, Chinese traditional music, as well as sounds from different eras, regions and styles around the world, which serves as a dazzling proof of the musicians’ capability. Orchestra members utilise rest time to compose and rehearse a range of new works drawing strong influences from the local cultural, social and artistic atmosphere that shine through their superb performance techniques, and of course, their tireless pursuit for musical excellency.
&lt;!--more--&gt;
The orchestra’s aims are to promote folk music culture and to explore contemporary music composition. The orchestra’s future plans include continued rehearsal of classical and contemporary works by Chinese and Western composers, while members will also write new pieces in which they present brave ideas and individual expression, combining elements of traditional Chinese culture, folk culture and a global vision in the context of composition, restructuring the modern perspective of unification of multiculturalism. Composition techniques are inventively modified and innovated from the traditional chamber music format, breaking the barriers between the traditional and the modern, the elegant and the down-to-earth, the east and the west. The musical styles of minority ethnic groups, folk art and contemporary sounds are combined perfectly in rich expressions of cultural character.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Mei's Dance Group</title>
                <description>
&lt;p&gt;The Mei’s Dance Group is South Australia’s first dance group to combine eastern and western cultural elements, incorporating Chinese flavours upon the original framework of Mei’s Dance Company, founded in February 2014 after a long effort owing to the enthusiasm of head of company Qingmei Zhou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The establishment of the group gives the multicultural city of Adelaide a brand new taste of China, enriching the lives of members of the local Chinese community, as well as providing people of other nationalities and cultures in Australia with the opportunity to enjoy the art of the orient.
&lt;!--more--&gt;
Each group that branches from Mei’s Dance Group aims to deliver the most unique representations of Chinese and Australian culture in folk and contemporary dance creations, determined to maintain high standards of professional quality at international levels. The group draws influences from a variety of artistic presentation forms, studies and explores the connections between traditional and modern Chinese culture while taking inspiration from modern western arts. Our working mission is to promote the dance culture of the two nations, service the multicultural arts community, and create art to face international acclaim. Our artistic mission is to spread the influence of oriental art, further cultural exchange, enrich culture and life, and improve health and fitness in communities. The group’s unique training style involves basic dance skills training, group training, as well as choreographing of various dance styles inspired by both Chinese and Australian cultural and artistic elements. We support the promotion of the art of contemporary dance, encourage those with a passion for dance to undergo a well and truly cutting edge dance experience, with a working aim to discover and train the group’s very own talents of world class potential, raise awareness and appreciation of the art of dance among the wider population, to our friends from all walks of life, uniting us in our contribution to cultural and artistic exchange between the two nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mei’s Dance Group has bred the following creative and cultural industries brands: the Mei* Contemporary Dance Group, the Dynamism Youth Dance Group, and the Dynamism Contemporary Folk Orchestra.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Yue Zhou</title>
                <description>
&lt;p&gt;The founder Q.M. Zhou is a professional dancer and choreographer. Under the influence of the dance coach she had who is her mother, Zhou received systematic professional training as a child, in styles including classical Chinese dance, Chinese folk and ethnic dance, and ballet. Zhou has majored in ballroom dancing at the Beijing Dance Academy, studied contemporary dance at TAFE SA, and is a prolific choreographer in Adelaide’s Chinese community holding dual degrees in dance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the past decade or so in my learning, I have given most of my time and energy to my dance career. I knew that there comes a time where I must pay back. My mother has supported me on my way throughout this journey, allowing me to navigate the field of dance with ease. I have received countless awards in various dance competitions, in which most of my performances were choreographed by my mother. I earned valuable teaching and stage experience during my time participating in Chinese style dance performance and choreography. When I was on the stage, whether I was performing a self-written routine or other people’s work, my mother always required that I face the task with utmost passion, not allowing me to commit even the slightest error. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If my study of dance in China can be counted as accumulation of experience, then my studies here in the capital city of South Australia would be improvement of practice. Moving from Chinese traditional dance to contemporary Western dance offered me the opportunity for a giant leap in my dance career. Through my transition from the Chinese traditional system of education to a much more liberal, self-directed education format, I gradually learnt to regulate my ability to adjust. And through the clashes between the differing dance cultures of Australia and China, I learnt of each of their most treasurable essences, witnessing first-hand the brilliance of each country’s artistic vocabulary. This provided me with abundant information to further cultural exchange between the two nations in future, and also gave me a solid foundation for later work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am an easy-going, cheerful and generous person. To be modest and a good listener, and to learn and grow is my motto. Outside of work, I enjoy chatting with my friends over a coffee or a meal. Of course, in multicultural Australia, I have friends from a variety of cultural backgrounds, since I like to make friends from different work environments and upbringings, and see it as a way of learning. Although I have lived in Adelaide for over a decade, I have always upheld my career and personal ethos, “three nos, three yeses” form my basic principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I will NOT give up my dedication and passion for dance due to changes in my environment.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I will NOT give up determination to achieve my dreams because of temporary difficulties.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I will NOT give up my faith and confidence in my goals because of setbacks from failure.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I am honest in my approaches towards others, and will cut off relations with those who have no morals, or are habitual liars.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I am a trustworthy person, who would always face my friends with a tolerant and respectful attitude, while people who are cunning and selfish will never be in my circle of friends.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I understand the importance of being thankful; I am thankful for that my parents have raised me and that my family have always supported me, thankful for all of my friends who have helped me in the past and present.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my mother was performing on stage while pregnant with a three-month-old me, fate has decided that I live to dance! To me, dance isn’t as simple as just moving my arms and legs, or repeating cycles of work, performance and skills training. Dance is the driving force of life flowing in my blood, the hardship and determination all along my road to today, the sheer happiness of producing a successful piece of work after gathering experience from having choreographed countless failed works. Dance is my eternal thanks to my mother for what she gave to me and my career, my endless memories of my father, the definitive positioning of my future career target!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, I would like to give thanks to my mother for fostering my career as a dance artist, to my father for encouraging me to be an all-rounded high achiever, to all of my teachers who had mentored me, to all of my friends who have given me their help and support.&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>
&lt;p&gt;创办人Q.M Zhou是一位专业的舞蹈演员兼舞蹈编导，在母亲这位舞蹈教授的熏陶下，自幼在中国接受了系统的专业训练 - 中国古典舞和中国民族民间舞，芭蕾舞，曾经就读北京舞蹈学院社交系专修国际标准舞，在阿德莱德艺术技术学院学习当代舞蹈，同时也是在阿德莱德华人中一位拥有舞蹈双学位的华人专业舞蹈编导。
之前十几年的学习舞蹈过程里我大部分的时间和精力都给了舞蹈事业，付出总有回报的时候，加上母亲一路上的扶持，让我在舞蹈领域里如鱼得水，而且在各种舞蹈比赛里得过无数的奖励，其中大部分是母亲编导的作品。在中国式的舞蹈演出和编舞历练期间我从中得到了宝贵的教学经验和舞台经验，在舞台上演出时不管是自己编导的舞蹈作品还是演示他人的舞蹈作品，都让我用心去完成，不能有丝毫的失误和偏差，尽量做到最完美，有时为了编排一个作品甚至和母亲争执到脸红脖子粗，到最后还要和母亲说对不起，即使是我没有错…..这就是我Q M Zhou. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;如果说在中国期间的舞蹈学习是经验积累的话，那么在南澳大利亚的省会阿德莱德期间的舞蹈学习应该是实践的提升。从传统的中国舞蹈到西方当代舞蹈我在自己的舞蹈事业上有了质的飞越。从接受中国传统的教育到后来接受西方自由发挥的教育中慢慢学会调节自己的适应能力。在中西舞蹈艺术文化的碰撞中我学到了两国间的艺术精髓，亲身体验到了中澳两国各自的舞蹈艺术语汇的精彩之处，为我能在未来积极推动两国文化交流提供了丰富的信息，同时也为以后的工作奠定了坚固的基础。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本人是位随和的人，性格开朗、大方，谦虚和聆听、边成长边学习是我的座右铭！在工作之余喜欢和朋友喝咖啡、吃饭、聊天，在澳洲这个有着多元文化的国土上当然朋友也是有着多元文化背景的，我喜欢结交不同工作环境和不同文化背景的朋友，这也是我学习的一种方式。虽然已经在阿德莱德生活了十几年，但是在事业和怎样做人上有自己的原则和底线，三‘不会’和三‘是’是我的基本理念：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;不会因为环境的改变而放弃对舞蹈的执着和热情&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;不会因为暂时的困难而放弃对梦想的实现和坚持&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;不会因为失败的挫折而放弃对目标的信心和信念&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;是爱憎分明的人，对没有道德观念和习惯性撒谎的人杜绝来往。&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;是值得信赖的人，对朋友始终保持宽容和尊重的心态，斤斤计较的小人永远不再朋友圈里。&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;是知道感恩的人，对父母的培养和家人支持的感恩，周围所有人曾经和现在对我帮助和扶持过的朋友的感恩。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;从母亲怀着只有3个月大的我在舞台上表演舞剧的那时起，命运就注定了我和舞蹈永远的结缘！舞蹈对于我来说不是单纯的手舞足蹈，不仅仅是每天的重复工作演出和基本功训练，舞蹈是流淌在我身体里的沸腾的能量血液，舞蹈是事业上一路走过来的坚信和艰辛，舞蹈是我在编排了无数个失败的作品背后所获得经验和一部成功作品的喜悦，舞蹈是万分感谢母亲在事业上的给予，舞蹈是我对父亲无限的思念，舞蹈是我未来事业目标的定位！&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;最后，感谢母亲对我在舞蹈事业上的栽培，感谢父亲教育我做一个品学兼优的舞者，感谢所有教授过我舞蹈技术的老师们。感谢所有朋友一路上的支持和扶持。&lt;/p&gt;

Although I have lived in Adelaide for over a decade, I have always upheld my career and personal ethos, “three nos, three yeses” form my basic principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I will NOT give up my dedication and passion for dance due to changes in my environment.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I will NOT give up determination to achieve my dreams because of temporary difficulties.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I will NOT give up my faith and confidence in my goals because of setbacks from failure.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I am honest in my approaches towards others, and will cut off relations with those who have no morals, or are habitual liars.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I am a trustworthy person, who would always face my friends with a tolerant and respectful attitude, while people who are cunning and selfish will never be in my circle of friends.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I understand the importance of being thankful; I am thankful for that my parents have raised me and that my family have always supported me, thankful for all of my friends who have helped me in the past and present.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my mother was performing on stage while pregnant with a three-month-old me, fate has decided that I live to dance! To me, dance isn’t as simple as just moving my arms and legs, or repeating cycles of work, performance and skills training. Dance is the driving force of life flowing in my blood, the hardship and determination all along my road to today, the sheer happiness of producing a successful piece of work after gathering experience from having choreographed countless failed works. Dance is my eternal thanks to my mother for what she gave to me and my career, my endless memories of my father, the definitive positioning of my future career target!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, I would like to give thanks to my mother for fostering my career as a dance artist, to my father for encouraging me to be an all-rounded high achiever, to all of my teachers who had mentored me, to all of my friends who have given me their help and support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The founder Q.M. Zhou is a professional dancer and choreographer. Under the influence of the dance coach she had who is her mother, Zhou received systematic professional training as a child, in styles including classical Chinese dance, Chinese folk and ethnic dance, and ballet. Zhou has majored in ballroom dancing at the Beijing Dance Academy, studied contemporary dance at TAFE SA, and is a prolific choreographer in Adelaide’s Chinese community holding dual degrees in dance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the past decade or so in my learning, I have given most of my time and energy to my dance career. I knew that there comes a time where I must pay back. My mother has supported me on my way throughout this journey, allowing me to navigate the field of dance with ease. I have received countless awards in various dance competitions, in which most of my performances were choreographed by my mother. I earned valuable teaching and stage experience during my time participating in Chinese style dance performance and choreography. When I was on the stage, whether I was performing a self-written routine or other people’s work, my mother always required that I face the task with utmost passion, not allowing me to commit even the slightest error. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If my study of dance in China can be counted as accumulation of experience, then my studies here in the capital city of South Australia would be improvement of practice. Moving from Chinese traditional dance to contemporary Western dance offered me the opportunity for a giant leap in my dance career. Through my transition from the Chinese traditional system of education to a much more liberal, self-directed education format, I gradually learnt to regulate my ability to adjust. And through the clashes between the differing dance cultures of Australia and China, I learnt of each of their most treasurable essences, witnessing first-hand the brilliance of each country’s artistic vocabulary. This provided me with abundant information to further cultural exchange between the two nations in future, and also gave me a solid foundation for later work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am an easy-going, cheerful and generous person. To be modest and a good listener, and to learn and grow is my motto. Outside of work, I enjoy chatting with my friends over a coffee or a meal.

&lt;p&gt;（名誉团长及语言和文化顾问）
现任阿德莱德大学亚洲研究中心中文系教授，阿德莱德大学孔子学院院长。
高教授在英国留学和工作先后八年，后来又先后在格里菲斯和塔斯马尼亚大学任教，于2008 年被阿德莱德大学聘任为中国研究讲座教授。
高默波教授的英文著作包括：《高家村》， 《汉语引论》， 《汉语指南》 和《为中国的过去而争论：毛和“文革》. 尤其是《高家村》 和《为中国的过去而争论：毛和“文革》两本书使他成为世界知名学者。
关于学术上的成功，高教授说；成功不过是一种经历，自己从来没有去考量自己走过的道路是否达到了成功的目标，只要做好自己愿意做的事情就足够了。他从来不为赶潮流或是搞研究去研究。 他甚至谦虚地说是自己的运气不错，有些机遇让自己遇到了而且也把握住了。现在只是觉得时间不够用，因为有很多计划要去实现，需要投入时间和精力。
作为孔子学院的院长，高教授在南澳努力为汉语推广和文化交流做了大量的工作。
高教授担任艺术团职位与本人在工作单位没有任何关系，属于本人自愿。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gao Mobo (Honorary dean、language and culture consultant) 
Professor Gao currently teaches Chinese at the Center for Asian Studies at the University of Adelaide, and dean of the University’s Confucius Institute.
Professor Gao studied in the UK, where he worked for eight years, and later worked at Griffith University in Queensland and taught at the University of Tasmania. In 2008 he was appointed Professor of Chinese Studies at the University of Adelaide.
His English books include: “Gao Village,” “Mandarin Chinese: An Introduction”, “A Reference to Mandarin Chinese”, and “The Battle for China’s Past: Mao and the Cultural Revolution”. In particular, the books “Gao Village” and “The Battle” led him to become a renowned scholar worldwide.
Gao said on academic success that “success is but an experience”, that he never considered if the path he had taken has reached the goal of success, and that as long as one does the things they want to do, it is enough. He never did research to catch the trend or for the sake of research. He even said modestly that his luck was good, that he came across opportunities as well as grasped them. Now, Gao just thinks that the time he has is not enough, as there are many plans to carry out, which need time and energy to be invested.
As dean of the Confucius Institute, Professor Gao put a lot of effort into the promotion of the Chinese language and cultural exchange in South Australia.
Professor Gao’s position in the group is of no relation to his position at his current workplace, and was in accordance with his own will.&lt;/p&gt;

K See is the current president of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce South Australia Inc、vice president of Chinese Welfare Service South Australia、ambassador of South Australia Convention Bureau、and general manager of See Brothers Seafood. See had devoted a lot of time and effort to the Chamber of Commerce, and due to its rapid development in recent years, he often gave up his own business and time to attend the organisation’s various events. See has said himself to be an ordinary businessman, but passionate about community development, eagerly involved in the Chinese community’s career development, which is why he spent time, energy and financial resources on social activities. The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce is committed to promoting trade between South Australia and China and cultural exchange under See’s leadership. 
See is full of anticipation and longing when it comes to South Australia’s future. He said: “everyone knows that doing community is difficult, I fully understand that, but I will stick to it even if it is difficult. Us Chinese people have a saying ‘take it from the community, use it on the community.’” 
See is honoured to be a part of the troupe, honoured to be able to work for the cultural life and cultural promotion of the Chinese community, especially while the fusion of the two countries’ dance culture is the troupe’s future plan and a brave attempt. He sincerely wishes the troupe a promising future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kok Wah See position in the group is of no relation to his position at his current workplace, and was in accordance with his own will.&lt;/p&gt;
